- Goal of RL: Maximizing long term reward
- RL encompasses supervised and unsupervised learning as special cases

- What is intelligence? : Intelligences measures an agent's ability to achieve goals a wide range of environments
    - Universal intelligence: Leeg & Hutter

- 'End-to-end' learning agents: from pixels to actions
- Deep learning enables End-to-End-learning (applieable to images, text, audio, video)
    - Automatically learn features
- Unsupervised Learning: ...

- Sequence Modeling: Allmost all data are sequence (Text, Video, Audio, ...)

- Human-level control trough deep reinforcement learning
    - ATARI-Games provides good platform for sequential decision making
    - Unified Action interface
    - Based on Deep-Q-Networks
